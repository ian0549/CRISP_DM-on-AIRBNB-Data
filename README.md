# Summary of the Analysis

This notebook uses data from the Seattle area of Airbnb and has been analyzed to answer the following questions.

**What type of property type are most people interested in?**

From the histogram of showing property type and number of reviews, House and Apartment are what most people are intereste in.

**What are the characteristics of listing that influence the price of listings?**

From the statistical inference of the model,property types with Boat,Dorm,Loft, and Treehouse greatly influenced the price of listings. Again, Shared room type had a high price tag than Prive room. Then, Doorman and Washer amenities really spiked the prices of listings. We also saw that higher number of bedrroms increase prices of listings

**When is the best time to host a listing for booking?**

There is a busy season and from the timeline there was definitely an increase every year of the number of people who travel. We found out that most of these travelers like to travel in september. So the best time to host a listing for booking is september
